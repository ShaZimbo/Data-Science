This code implements a simplified version of the Blackjack card game, allowing a player to compete against a dealer. The game begins by importing necessary modules, including random for random card selection, os for clearing the console, and visual elements like LOGO and FACE_DOWN_CARD from an external art module. The game logic is structured around several key functions: draw_card, deal_card, calculate_score, and compare.

The draw_card function generates a visual representation of a card based on its value (v) and suit (s). It uses formatted strings to create a card-like ASCII art, ensuring that the card's value and suit are displayed at the top-left and bottom-right corners. This function is used to visually represent the cards dealt to the player and the dealer.

The deal_card function is responsible for randomly selecting a card. It defines two dictionaries: suits, which maps suit names to their symbols (e.g., hearts, spades), and values, which maps card ranks (e.g., 2, 3, J, Q, K, A) to their corresponding numerical values. The function randomly selects a card value and suit, returning both the numerical value (for score calculation) and the visual representation (for display).

The calculate_score function computes the total score of a player's hand. It checks for special cases, such as a "BlackJack!" (a two-card hand totaling 21) and adjusts the value of an Ace (11 or 1) if the total score exceeds 21. This ensures that the game adheres to Blackjack rules, where an Ace can have a flexible value to prevent a bust.

The compare function determines the winner by comparing the player's and dealer's scores. It prints the cards and scores of both participants and evaluates the outcome based on Blackjack rules. Possible outcomes include a draw, a win or loss due to a "BlackJack!", a bust (score exceeding 21), or a higher score. The function provides feedback to the player with appropriate messages, such as "BlackJack! You win! ðŸ˜ƒ" or "Bust! You lose! ðŸ˜­".

The main game loop begins by displaying the LOGO and prompting the user to start a game or exit. If the player chooses to play, the console is cleared, and both the player and dealer are dealt two initial cards. The game continues until the player either chooses to stop drawing cards or their score exceeds 21. The dealer then draws cards until their score reaches at least 17. Finally, the compare function is called to determine the winner, and the player is given the option to play again or exit.
