The provided code is a comprehensive task management system implemented in Python. It includes functionalities for user authentication, task management, and administrative operations. The code begins by importing necessary libraries and setting up the current date format for task entries.

The validate_user function checks if a given username and password combination exists in the user data, which is retrieved by the get_user_data function. This function reads user information from a file named "user.txt" and decodes any special characters. Similarly, the get_tasks_data function reads task information from a file named "tasks.txt" and decodes special characters in the task details.

The menu_selection function displays the main menu options to the user, with additional options for the admin user. It returns the user's selection for further processing. The register_user function allows the admin to register a new user by ensuring the username and password meet specific criteria and do not contain commas. The new user information is then written to the "user.txt" file.

The display_statistics function provides a summary of the number of tasks and users in the system. The delete_user function allows the admin to delete a user from the system by removing the user from the user data and updating the "user.txt" file.

The task_management_menu function displays the task management options to the user. The add_task function allows users to add a new task by providing details such as the assigned user, task title, description, and due date. The task is then appended to the task list and written to the "tasks.txt" file.

The mark_task_complete function marks a specified task as complete by updating its status in the task list and writing the updated data to the "tasks.txt" file. The edit_task function allows users to edit various fields of a task, including the assigned user, title, description, and due date. The updated task information is then written to the "tasks.txt" file.

The update_task_data function writes the updated task list to the "tasks.txt" file, ensuring that any changes made to tasks are saved. The delete_task function removes a specified task from the task list and updates the "tasks.txt" file accordingly.

The display_task function prints the details of a single task in a formatted manner. The empty_lines function removes any empty lines from a specified file to maintain data integrity. The encode_special_chars and decode_special_chars functions handle the encoding and decoding of special characters in user and task data. Finally, the sanitize_input function trims whitespace from user input to ensure clean data entry.

Overall, this code provides a robust framework for managing tasks and users, with specific functionalities for adding, editing, deleting, and displaying tasks, as well as user registration and authentication.
