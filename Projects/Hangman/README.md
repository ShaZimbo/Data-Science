This code implements a basic version of the classic "Hangman" game. It begins by importing necessary modules and resources: random for selecting a random word, HANGMAN_IMAGE and HANGMAN_LOGO for visual elements, and hangman_words for the list of possible words. The game starts by displaying the HANGMAN_LOGO to introduce the game visually.

The variable LIVES is initialized to 6, representing the number of incorrect guesses a player can make before losing. A random word is selected from hangman_words and stored in chosen_word. To represent the hidden word, a PLACEHOLDER list is created with underscores (_) for each letter in the word, and it is displayed to the player. The all_guesses list is used to track all letters guessed by the player, preventing duplicate guesses.

The game runs in a while loop that continues until the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of lives. Inside the loop, the player is prompted to guess a letter. The input is converted to lowercase and stripped of extra spaces to ensure consistency. If the guessed letter has already been guessed (tracked in all_guesses), a warning message is displayed. If the guess is correct (i.e., the letter is in chosen_word), the letter is added to all_guesses, and the corresponding underscores in PLACEHOLDER are replaced with the correct letter. If the guess is incorrect, the player loses one life, and the guess is added to all_guesses.

After each guess, the updated PLACEHOLDER is displayed, showing the player's progress. The corresponding hangman image from HANGMAN_IMAGE is displayed based on the remaining lives, providing a visual representation of the player's status. The number of remaining lives is also printed.

The game ends when either all underscores in PLACEHOLDER are replaced (indicating the player has guessed the word) or LIVES reaches zero. If the player wins, a congratulatory message is displayed. If the player loses, the game reveals the correct word and displays a losing message. The use of colored text (via ANSI escape codes) enhances the user experience by making messages more visually distinct.
