The code is a Python script that sends a motivational quote via email every Wednesday. It begins by importing several modules: smtplib for sending emails, datetime for working with dates and times, random for selecting a random quote, and os for handling file paths. The script determines the directory in which it is running to reliably locate the quotes.txt file containing the motivational quotes.

The user is prompted to enter their email address and password, which are used to authenticate with the Gmail SMTP server.

The script constructs the full path to the quotes.txt file and reads all the quotes from it into a list. It then selects one quote at random from this list using the random.choice() function.

Next, the script checks the current day of the week using the datetime module. The weekday() method returns an integer where Monday is 0 and Wednesday is 2. If the current day is Wednesday, the script establishes a secure connection to Gmail's SMTP server using TLS encryption. It logs in with the provided email credentials and sends an email to a specified recipient with the subject "Wednesday Motivational Quote" and the randomly selected quote as the message body.

Overall, this script automates the process of sending a motivational quote every Wednesday. It demonstrates how to read from a file, select a random item, check the current day, and send an email using Python's built-in libraries. The use of user input for credentials makes it flexible, but for security and automation, storing credentials securely or using environment variables would be recommended in a production setting.

NOTE: User input was added to ensure no personal details were left in the code. You may need to change the code to match your email SMTP - search your email providers SMTP - as well as generate an app password from your email settings.
