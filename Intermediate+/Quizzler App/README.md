The code implements a graphical quiz application called "Quizzler" using Python and the Tkinter library. The application is structured using object-oriented programming, with three main classes: Question, QuizBrain, and QuizInterface. Each class is responsible for a specific aspect of the quiz logic or user interface.

The Question class is a simple data structure that stores the text and answer for each quiz question. The QuizBrain class manages the quiz logic, including tracking the current question number, the user's score, and the list of questions. It provides methods to determine if there are more questions (still_has_questions), retrieve the next question (next_question), and check if the user's answer is correct (check_answer). The next_question method also handles decoding any HTML entities in the question text to ensure proper display.

The QuizInterface class is responsible for setting up and managing the graphical user interface. It creates the main window, displays the current score, and shows each question on a canvas. The interface includes "True" and "False" buttons, each linked to methods that check the user's answer and provide immediate visual feedback by changing the background color of the question area to green for correct answers or red for incorrect ones. After a short delay, the interface automatically advances to the next question. When all questions have been answered, the interface displays a completion message and disables the answer buttons to prevent further input.

The main script (main.py) initializes the quiz by creating a list of Question objects from the provided question data, then instantiates the QuizBrain and QuizInterface classes. This design cleanly separates the quiz logic from the user interface, making the code modular and easy to maintain or extend. The result is an interactive, user-friendly quiz game that provides instant feedback and tracks the user's progress throughout the session.
