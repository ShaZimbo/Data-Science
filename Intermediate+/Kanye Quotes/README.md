The code creates a simple graphical application using Python’s Tkinter library that displays random quotes from Kanye West. The application window features a background image, a text area for the quote, and a button with Kanye’s image. When the user clicks the Kanye button, the app fetches a new quote from an online API and updates the displayed text.

At the start, the code imports the necessary modules: Tkinter for the GUI, os for file path management, and requests for making HTTP requests. The get_quote function is defined to handle the process of retrieving a quote. It sends a GET request to the "https://api.kanye.rest" API, waits up to 10 seconds for a response, and handles any timeout errors by printing a message. If the request is successful, it extracts the quote from the JSON response and updates the text displayed on the canvas.

The main window is set up with a title, padding, and a background color. The code determines the current directory to correctly locate the image files for the background and the Kanye button, ensuring the application works regardless of where it is run. A Tkinter Canvas widget is created to serve as the main display area, where the background image and the quote text are placed. The quote text is initially set to "Click Kanye for Quotes" and is centered on the canvas.

A button is created using the Kanye image, and it is configured to call the get_quote function whenever it is clicked. This allows the user to fetch a new quote on demand. The layout uses a grid system to position the canvas and the button. Finally, the Tkinter main loop is started to keep the window open and responsive to user interactions. Overall, the code demonstrates how to combine GUI elements, image handling, and web API requests to create an interactive and visually appealing application.
