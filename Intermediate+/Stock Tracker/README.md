The code is a Python script that monitors the stock price of Tesla (TSLA) and sends an email alert with relevant news articles if the stock price changes by more than a specified percentage. It uses several APIs and libraries to achieve this: the Alpha Vantage API for stock data, the NewsAPI for news articles, the smtplib library for sending emails, and the dotenv library to securely load sensitive credentials from environment variables.

At the beginning of the script, environment variables are loaded to retrieve API keys and email credentials. The script sets up parameters for querying the Alpha Vantage API to get daily time series data for Tesla stock. It then calculates the date 30 days prior to the current date, which is used as the starting point for fetching news articles. The script sends a request to the Alpha Vantage API and retrieves the two most recent closing prices for TSLA. It calculates the percentage difference between these two closing prices to determine if there has been a significant change.

If the absolute value of the percentage change exceeds the threshold defined by STOCK_CHANGE, the script proceeds to fetch the latest news articles about Tesla using the NewsAPI. It sorts the articles by publication date and selects the three most recent ones. The format_msg function is used to create a formatted message that includes the stock change and the headlines and descriptions of the selected news articles.

Finally, the script composes an email with the subject "Tesla Stocks Alert" and the formatted message body. It connects to Gmail's SMTP server using the provided credentials, logs in, and sends the email to the specified recipient. This automation allows the user to stay informed about significant changes in Tesla's stock price and receive timely news updates directly in their inbox.
