The provided code is a Python script that checks whether the International Space Station (ISS) is currently overhead and whether it is dark at the user's location. If both conditions are met, the script sends an email notification to prompt the user to look up and potentially see the ISS.

The script begins by importing necessary modules: datetime for handling date and time, sleep from the time module for periodic checks, smtplib for sending emails, and requests for making HTTP requests to external APIs. The user's latitude, longitude, email address, and email app password are defined as constants at the top of the script.

Two helper functions are defined: close and dark. The close function determines if the ISS is within Â±5 degrees of the user's latitude and longitude, indicating that it is nearby and potentially visible. The dark function checks if the current hour is after sunset or before sunrise, which are the conditions under which the ISS would be visible in the night sky. The function uses the current hour, as well as the sunrise and sunset times obtained from an API, to make this determination.

The script then retrieves the current position of the ISS by making a request to the "open-notify" API and parses the latitude and longitude from the response. It also fetches the sunrise and sunset times for the user's location from the "sunrise-sunset" API, extracting the hour component from the returned times. The current local time is obtained using datetime.now().

The main logic of the script is contained within an infinite loop that runs every 60 seconds. On each iteration, the script checks if the ISS is close and if it is currently dark using the previously defined helper functions. If both conditions are true, the script establishes a secure connection to Gmail's SMTP server, logs in with the provided credentials, and sends an email notification to the specified recipient. This process repeats indefinitely, ensuring that the user is notified whenever the ISS is overhead and visible. The script also includes basic error handling for network timeouts when making API requests.

NOTE: User input was added to ensure no personal details were left in the code. You may need to change the code to match your email SMTP - search your email providers SMTP - as well as generate an app password from your email settings.
