This Python script is a workout tracker that interacts with two APIs: Nutritionix (for exercise data) and Sheety (for storing workout logs in a spreadsheet). It begins by importing necessary modules, including os.environ for environment variables, datetime for timestamps, requests for HTTP requests, and dotenv for loading environment variables from a .env file. The script loads environment variables such as API keys and endpoints, which are required for authenticating and sending requests to the APIs.

The script captures the current date and time, then prompts the user to input the exercises they performed. It prepares HTTP headers with the Nutritionix API credentials and sends a POST request to the Nutritionix endpoint, passing the user's exercise description. If the request times out, it prints a timeout message. Upon a successful response, it parses the returned JSON to extract details about each exercise, such as the name, duration, and calories burned.

For each exercise, the script constructs a dictionary (sheet_inputs) containing the workout details, formatted for the Sheety API. It then prepares an authorization header using a bearer token and sends another POST request to the Sheety endpoint to log the workout data. Again, it handles potential timeouts gracefully. This approach allows users to track their workouts and store the data in a spreadsheet automatically, leveraging external APIs for both exercise parsing and data storage.
