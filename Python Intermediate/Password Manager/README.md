The code implements a graphical password manager application using Python’s Tkinter library. Its main features include generating secure passwords with customizable character composition, saving website login credentials to a JSON file, and searching for saved credentials. The application provides a user-friendly interface with entry fields, buttons, and dynamic widgets for all interactions.

At the top, the code defines lists of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols, which are used for password generation. The generate_password function dynamically creates labels and spinboxes in the UI, allowing the user to specify how many lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols they want in their password. When the user clicks the "Generate" button, a password is created according to these specifications, shuffled for randomness, inserted into the password entry field, and copied to the clipboard using the pyperclip library. All widgets related to password generation are tracked in the generator_widgets list so they can be easily removed later to keep the interface clean.

The save function handles storing website, username, and password information. It first checks that none of the fields are empty and then prompts the user for confirmation. If confirmed, it attempts to read the existing JSON file; if the file does not exist or is empty, it initializes an empty dictionary. The new credentials are added to the data and written back to the file. After saving, the entry fields are cleared, the password generator UI is reset using reset_generator_ui, and the focus is returned to the website entry field.

The web_search function allows users to retrieve saved credentials by entering a website name. It reads the JSON file and, if the website is found, displays the associated username and password in a message box and copies the password to the clipboard. If the website is not found or the file does not exist, an error message is shown.

The user interface is constructed using Tkinter widgets: labels for field names, entry fields for user input, and buttons for generating passwords, saving data, and searching for credentials. The layout uses the grid geometry manager for organized placement. A logo image is displayed at the top for a polished look. The application’s main loop keeps the window responsive and interactive. Overall, the code demonstrates use of Tkinter for dynamic UI creation, user input handling, and integration with file and clipboard operations to provide a practical password management tool.
