The code automates the process of creating personalized invitation letters using a template and a list of names. It begins by defining the file paths for the template letter (starting_letter.txt) and the list of invitee names (invited_names.txt). These files are expected to be located in specific directories within the project structure.

The program opens the file containing the names of the people to invite and reads it line by line. For each name, it removes any trailing newline characters to ensure the name is clean and ready for use. It then constructs a file path for the personalized invitation letter, placing it in the "ReadyToSend" output directory and naming the file after the invitee.

Next, the code opens the template letter file and creates a new file for the personalized invitation. It reads the template letter line by line, replacing every occurrence of the placeholder [name] with the actual invitee's name. Each modified line is then written to the new invitation file. This process repeats for every name in the list, resulting in a set of customized invitation letters, each tailored to a specific recipient and ready to be sent. The code demonstrates basic file handling, string manipulation, and automation of repetitive tasks in Python.
