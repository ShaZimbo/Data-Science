This code implements a Caesar cipher, a simple encryption and decryption technique that shifts letters in the alphabet by a specified number of positions. The program begins by importing a LOGO for visual branding and an alphabet list, which contains the characters used for encoding and decoding. The Caesar cipher logic is encapsulated in the caesar function, which takes three parameters: user_direction (either "encode" or "decode"), original_text (the input message), and shift_amount (the number of positions to shift).

The caesar function processes each letter in the original_text. If the letter exists in the alphabet, its index is adjusted based on the shift_amount. For encoding, the index is increased, while for decoding, it is decreased. The % operator ensures that the index wraps around if it exceeds the bounds of the alphabet. Non-alphabetic characters, such as spaces or punctuation, are added to the result without modification. The final encrypted or decrypted message is then printed to the user.

The program starts by displaying the LOGO and enters a loop controlled by the SHOULD_CONTINUE variable. Inside the loop, the user is prompted to choose between encoding and decoding. If the input is valid, the user provides the message and the shift amount, which are passed to the caesar function for processing. If the input is invalid, an error message is displayed. After each operation, the user is asked if they want to continue. If the user types "yes," the loop repeats; otherwise, the program ends.

This implementation is user-friendly, handling both uppercase and lowercase inputs by converting everything to lowercase. It also gracefully handles non-alphabetic characters, ensuring that the output retains the original structure of the input message. The modular design of the caesar function makes the code reusable and easy to understand.
