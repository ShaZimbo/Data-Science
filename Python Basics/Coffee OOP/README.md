This code implements a coffee machine program using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It utilizes three classes: Menu, CoffeeMaker, and MoneyMachine, which are imported from separate modules. These classes encapsulate the functionality of managing the menu, handling coffee-making operations, and processing payments, respectively. The program is designed to run in a continuous loop, allowing users to interact with the coffee machine until they choose to turn it off.

The Menu class is instantiated as menu and is responsible for managing the available drink options. The get_items() method is used to retrieve a string of available drinks, which is displayed to the user as part of the input prompt. The CoffeeMaker class, instantiated as coffee_maker, handles the machine's resources (e.g., water, milk, coffee) and ensures that there are sufficient resources to make the selected drink. The MoneyMachine class, instantiated as money_machine, manages the financial transactions, including checking if the user has inserted enough money and updating the machine's total earnings.

The program begins by entering an infinite while loop, which continuously prompts the user to select a drink or perform maintenance actions. If the user types "report," the program calls the report() methods of both the CoffeeMaker and MoneyMachine classes to display the current status of resources and earnings. If the user types "off," the program prints a goodbye message and exits the loop, effectively shutting down the coffee machine.

For any other input, the program assumes the user has selected a drink. It uses the find_drink() method of the Menu class to retrieve the corresponding drink object. If the drink exists, the program checks if there are sufficient resources to make the drink using the is_resource_sufficient() method of the CoffeeMaker class. If resources are sufficient, the program displays the cost of the drink and calls the make_payment() method of the MoneyMachine class to process the payment. Once the payment is successful, the make_coffee() method of the CoffeeMaker class is called to prepare the drink.
