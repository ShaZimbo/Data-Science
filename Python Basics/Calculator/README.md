This code is part of a calculator program that allows users to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It begins by displaying a LOGO (imported from another module) to provide a visual introduction to the program. The user is then prompted to input the first number, which is stored in the variable first_number. This number serves as the starting point for the calculations.

The program enters an infinite while loop, enabling the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program. Inside the loop, the available operations (+, -, *, /) are displayed by iterating through the keys of the operations_dictionary. The user is prompted to select an operation, and if the input is invalid (not one of the four symbols), the program repeatedly prompts the user until a valid operation is provided.

Once a valid operation is selected, the user is asked to input the second number, stored in the variable next_number. Before performing the calculation, the program checks if the operation is division (/) and whether the second number is zero. If the user attempts to divide by zero, an error message is displayed, and the program skips the calculation. Otherwise, the program retrieves the corresponding function from the operations_dictionary and applies it to first_number and next_number. The result of the calculation is stored in the variable output and displayed in the format first_number operation next_number = output.

After displaying the result, the program asks the user whether they want to continue calculating with the current result or start a new calculation. If the user types "y," the result (output) becomes the new first_number, allowing for continuous calculations. If the user types "n," the console is cleared using os.system('cls'), the LOGO is displayed again, and the user is prompted to enter a new first number, effectively starting a fresh calculation. If the user enters any other input, the program prints a "Goodbye!" message and exits the loop, terminating the program.

This implementation is user-friendly and modular, allowing for continuous calculations and handling invalid inputs gracefully. The use of a dictionary to map operations to functions makes the code extensible, as new operations can be added easily. Additionally, the program includes a check to prevent division by zero, ensuring robustness. The use of os.system('cls') to clear the console enhances the user experience by maintaining a clean interface during repeated calculations.
